Zerubbabel$1$1$These are the words which came unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, prince of Judah on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Zerubbabel$1$2$This is the vision which the LORD shewed unto me, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, which I saw while I was bowed in prayer before the LORD my God by the river Chebar, AND I BEHELD IT until the sight of the vision was heavy upon me. 
Zerubbabel$1$3$And I said, Blessed art Thou, O LORD, who resurrects the dead; my heart groaned within me, Where art thou, O Rock of ages? (Or, 'What will be the form of the everlasting temple?')
Zerubbabel$1$4$And the LORD answered me from the gates of the heavenly temple, saying, Zerubbabel, thou art a prince of Judah.
Zerubbabel$1$5$And I answered, I am thy servant. 
Zerubbabel$1$6$And WHEN He answered me, He spake unto me as a man speaketh unto his friend; and I heard His voice, but I could not see His form.   
Zerubbabel$1$7$And He spake unto me there, saying, O Zerubbabel, art thou my servant? And I answered, I am Thy servant. 
Zerubbabel$1$8$And He said, Come unto Me; ask and I shall declare it to you. 
Zerubbabel$1$9$When I heard this, I fell upon my face, and said, O LORD, declare unto me concerning the Prince of the covenant. 
Zerubbabel$1$10$THE DESPISED AND LOWLY MESSIAH
Zerubbabel$1$11$And AT THAT TIME I was lifted up by the spirit between heaven and earth, and it brought unto the great city of Niniveh, the city of blood.
Zerubbabel$1$12$And my soul was exceeding grieved, and I thought within myself, Woe is me, for my heart hath been false.  
Zerubbabel$1$13$Therefore in my sorrow, I arose with haste that I might pray for mercy, and entreat the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel (Or, 'to the face of the LORD God of Israel'). 
Zerubbabel$1$14$And I confessed all of my transgressions and the iniquity of my heart, for it hath been false. And I said, O LORD, I have turned aside; I have sinned in all of my transgressions and THE INIQUITY OF my heart hath been false.  
Zerubbabel$1$15$Thou, O LORD, are the God who made all things by the word of Thy mouth, and by the breathe of Thy lips the dead shall live. (Ps. 33:6,9)
Zerubbabel$1$16$Then He said unto me, Go unto the house of uncleanness, nigh unto the market district. And I went even as He commanded me.  
Zerubbabel$1$17$And He said unto me, Turn thyself this way. And when I turned, He touched me, and I beheld a man, greatly wounded and despised, lowly (Or, 'broken down') and afflicted.  
Zerubbabel$1$18$And the despised man said unto me, Zerubbabel, what dost thou seek here, and who brought ye hither?  (Or, who is afflicted here, and what hath brought ye hither?)
Zerubbabel$1$19$And I answered, The Spirit of the LORD hath lifted me up, and set me in this place.  
Zerubbabel$1$20$And he said unto me, Do not be afraid, for ye have been brought hither that He might shew unto thee the truth, that ye might declare it unto the children of Israel of all which thou hast seen.  
Zerubbabel$1$21$And when I heard his words, I was comforted and my heart was at rest.   
Zerubbabel$1$22$And I asked him, Sir, what is the name of this place?  
Zerubbabel$1$23$And he said unto me, This is Nineveh, the city of blood, which is Rome the great, wherein I am taken captive (Or, 'Ruma'; that is, a place in Galilee of Israel) ('and I am imprisoned here') here until the time of the end. 
Zerubbabel$2$1$And I asked him AGAIN, saying, Sir, who art thou and what is thy name?
